* You must select `Markdown` as content for a node
* when exporting a mindmap as markdown (plaintext), the markdown-nodes will be
  exported ad proper markdown: headings become headings, test becomes text etc.
  + this behaviour differs from just exporting default mindmaps as  markdown,
    by which every node will be a header of different depth
* this way, one can format the Text in a mindmap and later export a mindmap as a
  valid markdown textfile for further work
